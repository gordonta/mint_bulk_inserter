Hello.  I wrote this code because I was bored at drill and mint would only allow me to upload 90 days worth of transactions from my Bank.
I identified that you could manually add transactions and proxied the request to manually upload a transaction, which was a POST request to /updateTransaction.xevent
So I tested manually editing that in burp repeater and sending it back- lo and behold it works.  SO I built this python script to automate adding
transactions that I exported from my bank account.

Note- The token and cookie expire periodically.  You need to stay relatively active on mint in your browser otherwise the cookies will time out and your script will not work. 
/updateTransaction.xevent returns a 200 even if the session is inactive and POST requests to that endpoint do not "refresh" your cookie activity, so
you need to manually stay and refresh your mint session while the script is running.
